char = 7 #Characteristic of the field.
poly=[[0],[2,3,0,0],[1,1,0,1],[1,0,1,1]] #This is the polynomial. Every vector is a monomial: The first value is the coefficient and the other values are the degree of each variable. For example, the monomial 3X_1(x_2)^3x_3 is represented by (3,1,3,1). 
dimension = 4 #maximal degree of each variable
